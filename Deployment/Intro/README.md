1. What is Cloud Computing & Why Would We Use It?
	> Cloud computing can simply be thought of as transforming an Information Technology (IT) product into a service. With our vacation photos example, we transformed storing photos on an IT product, the flash drive; into storing them using a service, like Google Drive.
	* Benefits
	> 1. Reduced Investments and Proportional Costs (providing cost reduction)
	> 1. Increased Scalability (providing simplified capacity planning)
	> 1. Increased Availability and Reliability (providing organizational agility)
	* Risks
	> 1. (Potential) Increase in Security Vulnerabilities 
	> 1. Reduced Operational Governance Control (over cloud resources)
	> 1. Limited Portability Between Cloud Providers
	> 1. Multi-regional Compliance and Legal Issues
